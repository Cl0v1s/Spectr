Spectr is an experience to test the sound management in javascript.


How to play ?
_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
The objective of the game is really simple.
In fact, you just have to put the blocks to the shapes on background.
For that you have 3 tools.
You can push the blocks, you can eat them and finally, inflate them.
When you eat a block, youre fat level increase.
When you inflate a block, youre fat level decrease.
To change your tool, you must press "B".
Sometimes, Monsters appear in the screen.
There are three types of monsters.
-The Hangrer, who eat the blocks.
-The Fater, who inflate the Blocks.
-The Vices, who steal you a life when they hit you.
With pressing "space" you can afraid the Vices.
